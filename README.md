Replaces your all of your reddit comments with a random string and then deletes them.

To use it adapt the config.json to your reddit api credentials and simply run it from console. Then sit back & relax and wait a few minutes until it's done. If the script needs to delete a lot of comments it will take a while, since only one api call per 2 seconds is allowed by reddit.
